MyRedBlackTree contains my implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure with the 
public methods' signatures and descriptions given by my professor Dr. Fox so we would know what each method was meant to achieve and what time complexities we should aim for. 
I used my class's implementation of a regular BST (written by Dr. Fox) and my class notes to design my implementation.

This project contains many computer science subjects like inOrder transversal, Binary Tree rotations, searching and sorting algorithms, formal proofs for time complexities,
knowledgeable of Java pointers, stack variables, public and private methods/instance variables, and much more.
